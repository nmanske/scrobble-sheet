# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run a single package's tests
go test ./internal/syncer/...

# Run with dry-run (no writes)
go run ./cmd/lastfm-sheet-sync sync --dry-run

# Backfill from all Last.fm history
go run ./cmd/lastfm-sheet-sync backfill --reset-state

# Import an existing manual sheet
go run ./cmd/lastfm-sheet-sync import-legacy

# Build a binary
go build -o bin/lastfm-sheet-sync ./cmd/lastfm-sheet-sync
```

Requires Go 1.23+. Uses only the standard library — no external dependencies.

## Architecture

The service pulls scrobbles from Last.fm, resolves album metadata (via Last.fm then MusicBrainz as fallback), tracks per-album listening progress in local state, and writes one deduplicated row per release into one of three Google Sheets tabs.

### Data flow

```
Last.fm API → lastfm.Client → syncer.Service → sheets.Client → Google Sheets
                ↑                    ↑
           MusicBrainz API      state.Store (./data/state/state.json)
           disk cache           album cache (./data/cache/*.json)
```

### Key packages

- **`internal/model`** — all shared types: `Config`, `State`, `AlbumState`, `SheetRow`, `Scrobble`, `AlbumMetadata`, and `NormalizeKey`/`NormalizeText` used everywhere for deduplication keys.
- **`internal/syncer`** — the core logic. `Service.Run` dispatches to `runSync`, `runBackfill`, or `runImportLegacy`. The central method is `applyScrobble`, which determines which sheet index to use (Albums/Singles/EP), creates or updates the row, tracks heard track ranks, and marks completion.
- **`internal/lastfm`** — Last.fm XML API client plus MusicBrainz JSON lookup. `ResolveAlbum` first checks disk cache, then queries Last.fm by artist+album (preferred over MBID), then supplements from MusicBrainz if the MBID is present and data is incomplete. Rate-limited separately for each API (Last.fm: configurable, MusicBrainz: 1 req/s).
- **`internal/sheets`** — Google Sheets REST client. Reads full rows from a named tab; writes via batch update.
- **`internal/googleauth`** — JWT/OAuth2 service-account flow, no external library.
- **`internal/state`** — JSON state file with atomic write (write-to-temp + rename).
- **`internal/config`** — loads `.env` then environment variables; validates required vars per mode.

### Sheet routing

Releases are routed to one of three tabs based on MusicBrainz `primary-type`:
- `Album` → `Albums (Auto)` (`ALBUMS_SHEET_NAME`)
- `EP` → `EP (Auto)` (`EP_SHEET_NAME`)
- `Single`, or releases with no MBID and exactly one track → `Singles (Auto)` (`SINGLES_SHEET_NAME`)

### Deduplication / state key

`model.NormalizeKey(artist, album)` produces a `"normalized_artist|normalized_album"` string used as the map key in both `state.json` and the in-memory `sheetIndex.rowsByKey`. Multiple key variants (raw scrobble, canonical from Last.fm) are aliased to the same `*SheetRow` pointer.

### Album completion

An album is complete when every track rank 1..N has been heard. While incomplete, `Notes` holds a comma-separated list of missing track numbers and `DateListened` is blank. On completion, `DateListened` is set to the date of the first scrobble of that album and `Notes` is cleared.
